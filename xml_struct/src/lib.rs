//! This crate provides a mechanism for serializing Rust data structures as
//! well-formed XML with a minimum of boilerplate.
//!
//! Consumers can provide manual implementations of the [`XmlSerialize`] and
//! [`XmlSerializeAttr`] traits if desired, but the primary intent of this crate
//! is to provide automated derivation of these traits in order to facilitate
//! serialization of complex XML structures.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! At present, derived implementations of these traits are designed to handle
//! the specific case of Microsoft Exchange Web Services. As such, all XML
//! elements and attributes are named in PascalCase and certain behaviors are
//! not supported (such as serializing enum variants without enclosing XML
//! elements derived from the variant name).
//!
//! Furthermore, the PascalCase implementation is na√Øve and depends on
//! [`char::to_ascii_uppercase`], making it unsuitable for use with non-ASCII
//! identifiers.
//!
//! There is also currently no provision for deserialization from XML, as the
//! support offered by `quick_xml`'s serde implementation has been found to be
//! sufficient for the time being.
//!
//! In recognition of these limitations, this crate should not be published to
//! crates.io at this time. If a generalized implementation generates interest
//! or is thought to have merit, these limitations may be addressed at a later
//! time.
